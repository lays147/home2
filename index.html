              <p>
                Learning to solve problems. That's my <i>Modus Operandi</i>. I am always trying to create solutions to
                problems.
                And the context of those problems can be: Cloud Architecture, CI/CD Pipelines, build API's to delivery
                information among Rest, GraphQL and gRPC technologies.
                If it's a challenge and I can work on it, doesn't matter the context.
                However, I do like to work with backend applications and build the architecture for those applications
                on AWS. My front end skills are minimal.

              <h4 class="has-text-info has-text-weight-light">What do I like to do besides work?</h4>
              <p>
                Netflix. Read books. To ride a bike or car. Get out with my friends for beer & pizza. Chill with my
                boyfriend. Therapy.
                Travel. Dream. To eat and enjoy good food. Discover new places. Realize that I can be wrong an that's
                ok. To be honest. <strong>To be me.</strong>

              <h4 class="has-text-info has-text-weight-light">Bachelor of Information Systems</h4>
              <p>
                <strong>Sep/2017 - Out/2019</strong></br>
                I have a Bachelor of Information Systems by the Federal Fluminense University(UFF).</br>
                Before the Information Systems course, I have done 6 years of Computer Science at the same University.
                However, I have found on the Information Systems the pleasure to work with technology, besides the tech
                itself.
                The course has 3 pilars: Technology, People and Processes. And we are in a time where those 3 subjects
                converge
                on delivering the <strong>value</strong> to the customer.
